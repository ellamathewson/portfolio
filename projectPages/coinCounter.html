                The purpose of this program is to help students visualize monetary values. 
                Although this can benefit anyone who is a more visual learner, our target audience is intended 
                for special ed students and/or younger children who, when asked to give change for a specific value, 
                cannot visualize the bills and coins needed. In order to solve this problem, we made this program to 
                allow the user to input an amount, which will then be shown with the physical equivalence with the 
                number of coins/bills alongside it. To assist with giving change, the user only has to input the 
                starting cost and then click on the money that was given to them, and then the program will 
                calculate the change and show which bills and coins to use (and how much of each).

                Using Bootstrap, THREE.js, Animate CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS, this site was made. 
                All artwork was made by this team using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.

                On this team I was Lead Web Developer. I worked on creating the user interface, making it simplistic and 
                friendly to use to account for the attended audience. I worked closely with my other team members, making sure
                the website reflected the art created for it as well as the interface working well with the intended functionality 
                we wanted to implement.
