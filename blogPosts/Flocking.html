                    Exercise for Current Topics in Interactive Development. 
                    In this AR interactive piece we adapted an old project from a previous class 
                    to work in AR. The project uses the Ground Plane to display the terrain on which 
                    an array of agents flock to an egg, which is randomized on the screen every time they 
                    come into contact.

                    Upon starting the game the splash screen is displayed, showcasing the prefabs and 
                    target object. The user is able to click to progress to the main screen, which is 
                    through the AR camera. By pointing the camera at the ground scene target and clicking,
                    the scene loads in.

                    The chickens are seen flocking towards the egg, which has been instantiated at
                    a random point in the scene. The ducks are seen moving off the screen. But don't worry,
                    by clicking the button that says 'ducks' at the top of the screen, they come back in 
                    and replace the chickens in their hunt after the egg. The same switch happens when 
                    the user pressed the 'chicken' button. Pressing the 'exit' button stops the 
                    experience.

                    The prefabs are able to switch out by having the current object they're seeking change. 
                    When on the screen, they are seeking the egg; when the button is pressed for the other 
                    prefab, the current one changes to seek an off screen target, whereas the prefabs currently 
                    seeking the offscreen target change to begin seeking the egg on screen.

                    I wanted the overall theme to feel like being on a farm, which is why the prefabs 
                    were both animal related. I also made the terrain by using a dirt material and making 
                    it slightly transparent. By making it transparent it fixed a small bug of the 
                    prefabs disappearing beneath the ground plane stage when seeking the egg.
